# FATUM-MARK2

**Quantum Randomness Simulation Engine**

FATUM-MARK2 is a suite of decision-making tools powered by **CURBy**, the University of Colorado Randomness Beacon. It leverages quantum randomness to run simulations and identify statistical patterns in the noise, offering a unique approach to decision-making, geolocation, and more.

## Features

*   **Quantum Entropy:** Fetches true random numbers generated by quantum processes from the CURBy beacon.
*   **Simulation Engine:** Capable of running hundreds, thousands, or theoretically millions of simulations to find "winners" in the noise.
*   **Web Interface:** A local web server with a Cyberpunk-themed UI for interacting with the tools.
*   **Decision Tool:** Define custom options and let the quantum noise decide the outcome based on statistical distribution.

## Prerequisites

*   **Rust:** You need to have the Rust toolchain installed (Cargo, rustc).
*   **Internet Connection:** The application requires an active internet connection to fetch data from `https://random.colorado.edu`.

## Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already).
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd fatum-mark2
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
4.  **Open the Web Interface:**
    Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to:
    `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

## Tools

### Quantum Decision Tree
Located in the web interface.
1.  Enter a list of possible outcomes (e.g., "Yes, No, Maybe" or "Pizza, Sushi, Burger").
2.  Select the **Simulation Count**. Higher counts require more quantum data and take longer to fetch but provide a larger statistical sample.
3.  Click **INITIATE SIMULATION**.
4.  View the detailed report, including the "Winner" (most frequent result) and any statistical anomalies detected.

## Architecture

*   **Backend:** Rust (Axum, Tokio, Reqwest)
*   **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS (Vanilla)
*   **Entropy Source:** CURBy (University of Colorado Randomness Beacon)

This tool is for entertainment and experimental purposes. The "patterns" found in quantum noise are statistical phenomena and should not be taken as absolute predictions or financial/life advice.
