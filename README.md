# FATUM-MARK2

**Quantum Randomness Simulation Engine**

FATUM-MARK2 is a suite of decision-making tools powered by **CURBy**, the University of Colorado Randomness Beacon. It leverages quantum randomness to run simulations and identify statistical patterns in the noise, offering a unique approach to decision-making, geolocation, and more.

## Features

*   **Quantum Entropy:** Fetches true random numbers generated by quantum processes from the CURBy beacon.
*   **Seeded Simulations:** Uses quantum entropy to seed high-performance pseudo-random generators, allowing for millions of reproducible simulations derived from a true quantum source.
*   **Web Interface:** A local web server with a Cyberpunk-themed UI.
*   **CLI Mode:** Command-line tools for specific functions like Feng Shui calculations.

## Tools

### 1. Quantum Decision Tree
*   **Goal:** Make choices based on statistical anomalies in quantum noise.
*   **Process:** Enter options -> System runs millions of quantum-seeded choices -> Winner is selected.

### 2. Quantum Geolocation (Randonautica Inspired)
*   **Goal:** Find "Attractors" (high-density clusters of random points) near your location.
*   **Usage:**
    *   Open the Web Interface.
    *   Allow Location Access (GPS).
    *   Set Radius and Simulation Count (up to 1,000,000).
    *   Go to the generated coordinates.

### 3. Quantum Feng Shui
*   **Goal:** Determine optimal directions and sectors based on Quantum Chaos and traditional Feng Shui Kua numbers.
*   **Usage:** Enter (optional) birth year/gender. The system combines this with quantum noise to highlight a "Focus Sector" of your life (e.g., Wealth, Career) and provides advice.

## Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd fatum-mark2
    ```
3.  **Run the Web Server (Default):**
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
    Then open `http://127.0.0.1:3000` in your browser.

4.  **Run the CLI Tool (Feng Shui):**
    ```bash
    cargo run -- --command feng-shui
    ```

## Architecture

*   **Backend:** Rust (Axum, Tokio, Reqwest, Clap)
*   **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS (Vanilla)
*   **Math:** `rand_chacha` (CSPRNG) seeded by CURBy Quantum Entropy.

## Future Plans

*   **Mobile Application:** Porting the Geolocation tool to a native mobile app for easier outdoor use.
*   **Advanced Anomaly Detection:** Implementing more rigorous statistical tests (Z-scores, Chi-squared) to find "ghosts" in the machine.
*   **IoT Integration:** Using hardware quantum generators (like specific USB devices) as a local entropy source fallback.
*   **Map Visualization:** Visualizing the cluster points directly on a map in the UI.

This tool is for entertainment and experimental purposes. The "patterns" found in quantum noise are statistical phenomena and should not be taken as absolute predictions or financial/life advice.
