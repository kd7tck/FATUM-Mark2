# FATUM-MARK2

**Quantum Randomness Simulation Engine**

FATUM-MARK2 is a suite of decision-making tools powered by **CURBy**, the University of Colorado Randomness Beacon. It leverages quantum randomness to run simulations and identify statistical patterns in the noise, offering a unique approach to decision-making, geolocation, and more.

## Features

*   **Quantum Entropy:** Fetches true random numbers generated by quantum processes from the CURBy beacon.
*   **Seeded Simulations:** Uses quantum entropy to seed high-performance pseudo-random generators, allowing for millions of reproducible simulations derived from a true quantum source.
*   **Web Interface:** A local web server with a Cyberpunk-themed UI.
*   **CLI Mode:** Command-line tools for specific functions like Feng Shui calculations.

## Tools

### 1. Quantum Decision Tree
*   **Goal:** Make choices based on statistical anomalies in quantum noise.
*   **Process:** Enter options -> System runs millions of quantum-seeded choices -> Winner is selected.

### 2. Quantum Geolocation (Randonautica Inspired)
*   **Goal:** Find "Attractors" (high-density clusters of random points) near your location.
*   **Usage:**
    *   Open the Web Interface.
    *   Allow Location Access (GPS).
    *   Set Radius and Simulation Count (up to 1,000,000).
    *   Go to the generated coordinates.

### 3. Quantum Feng Shui & Flying Stars
*   **Goal:** Comprehensive analysis of your environment using Traditional Feng Shui (Xuan Kong Flying Stars) and Quantum Entropy.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Flying Star Chart:** Generates the full 9-palace chart based on construction period and facing direction (24 Mountains). Includes Mountain, Water, and Annual Stars.
    *   **Kua Profile:** Calculates Life Gua number, element, group, and lucky/unlucky directions.
    *   **Quantum Qi Scan:** Uses quantum entropy to detect "energy volatility" and anomalies in specific sectors.
    *   **Intention Resonance:** Checks if a user's specific intention aligns with the current energy of the house.
*   **Usage (Web):** Access via the local web interface.
*   **Usage (CLI Backup):**
    *   This is the **primary backup method** if the web interface is unavailable or if you prefer a text-based report.
    *   Command: `cargo run -- --command feng-shui`
    *   Follow the prompts to enter Birth Year, Construction Year, and Facing Direction.

## Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd fatum-mark2
    ```
3.  **Run the Web Server (Default):**
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
    Then open `http://127.0.0.1:3000` in your browser.

4.  **Run the CLI Tool (Feng Shui):**
    ```bash
    cargo run -- --command feng-shui
    ```

## Architecture

*   **Backend:** Rust (Axum, Tokio, Reqwest, Clap)
*   **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS (Vanilla)
*   **Math:** `rand_chacha` (CSPRNG) seeded by CURBy Quantum Entropy.

This tool is for entertainment and experimental purposes. The "patterns" found in quantum noise are statistical phenomena and should not be taken as absolute predictions or financial/life advice.
